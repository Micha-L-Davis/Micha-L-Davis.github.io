# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

 * A component is a modular, reusable software object that is designed to interoperate with other components.
 * The [characteristics of a component](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm#characteristics-of-components) are:
     * **Reusability**
     * **Replaceable**
     * **Not context specific**
     * **Extensible**
     * **Encapsulated**
     * **Independent**
 * The [advantages of component-based architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm#advantages) are:
     * **Ease of deployment**
     * **Reduced cost**
     * **Ease of development**
     * **Reusable**
     * **Modification of technical complexity**
     * **Reliability**
     * **System maintenance and evolution**
     * **Independent**

## Props in React

* `props` is short for "properties"
* Props are used in React to pass information between React components
* Information is passed down from parent component to child components. 

## Things I want to know more about

* The additional features available to Function or Class components

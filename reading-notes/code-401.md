# Introduction to SQL

In general, relational databases organize data into column-major tables.  These tables can include a column (or several) of unique KEY values. By creating a relationship between the keys on tables we can store related data accross many tables to compartmentalize information for efficient storage. In this way, one can more easily access only the relevant information without having to sort through all the information related to a given key.

The method of querying, creating, modifying and deleting elements of a relational database or its data is SQL, a language that uses plain and simple language to construct potentially complex queries without a heap of technical knowledge.

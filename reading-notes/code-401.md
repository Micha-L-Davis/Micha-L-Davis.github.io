# Introduction to SQL

In general, relational databases organize data into column-major tables.  These tables can include a column (or several) of unique KEY values. By creating a relationship between the keys on tables we can store related data accross many tables to compartmentalize information for efficient storage. In this way, one can more easily access only the relevant information without having to sort through all the information related to a given key.

The method of querying, creating, modifying and deleting elements of a relational database or its data is SQL, a language that uses plain and simple language to construct potentially complex queries without a heap of technical knowledge.

# Practice in the Terminal

The [Bash tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) were a good refresher on useful commands for the terminal. I've been using Linux/Unix and Bash on and off for much of my professional career, and before that the first operating system I'd ever used was command-line DOS. So I feel pretty comfortable overall using the terminal to crawl through file and directory trees and do what I need to do.  One thing I noticed that I don't think I've ever had occasion to use is `CTRL + Z`, which I wonder if it might be useful when I want to use the CLI while I'm hosting a server from a terminal rather than killing the server session with `CTRL + C` and then restarting it after I do whatever it is I needed to do.

Also, I appreciate that there's a way to handle spaces in file names but... why would you? Sounds like an invitation to disaster if you ask me.
